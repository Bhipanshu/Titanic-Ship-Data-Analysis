# Titanic-Ship-Data-Analysis

In this project I dived into the fascinating world of Titanic analysis, exploring the historical data of the infamous shipwreck. With the power of Power BI, I unveiled hidden insights and trends that shed light on the tragic event.
ðŸ“ˆ Through interactive visualizations and data exploration, I uncovered patterns in passenger demographics, ticket fares, survival rates, and more. It was an incredible journey to see how data storytelling can unveil compelling narratives.
